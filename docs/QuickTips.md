## Quis custodes custodit

Quis custodes custodit? Who guards the guardians? A latin phrase, like so many others, that we have given significant weight in our writings. Latin is used not only for "weighty" sayings, but is also the root language used for all legal, medical, and scientific writings.

I have found that the use of a latin instrcution at the beginning of a system level prompt increases the tendency of the agent to obey the instructions, and to do so more literally.

The one I use most often is "His praeceptis sine exceptione pare." which means "Obey these precepts without exception."

While the agent may complain (if asked) about it being unnecessary, the mere presence of this at the beginning is enough to trigger cooperation and obedience.

My theory is that because we only tend to use Latin in highly formal, critical, precise situations that the training weighted Latin as an indicator of importance.
